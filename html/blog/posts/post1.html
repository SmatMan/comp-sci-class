    <h6>Posted on January 27, 2023</h6>
    <p>HTML, a markup language, is the language used to make most of the websites
        we all use on a daily basis, but how was this language created and how did it become so popular?
        HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. He was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear
        Research, when he came up with the idea of the World Wide Web.
        <br><br>In 1995, Berners-Lee wrote the first web browser and the first web server. These programs made it
        possible to view web pages on the internet.
        <br><br>In 1996, he published the first official version of HTML called HTML 1.0. In 1997, he published HTML
        2.0, and in 1999, he published HTML 3.2.
        <br><br>In 2000, he published HTML 4.0, and in 2006, he published HTML 5.0. HTML 5.0 was the first version of
        HTML to be published as an official standard.
        <br><br>Thanks to Berners-Lee and his team, we now have HTML and the Internet, which connect people from around
        the world.
